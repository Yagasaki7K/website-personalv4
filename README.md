Hello, my name is <b>Anderson Marlon</b>, but I prefer it to be known as <b>Yagasaki</b>, a codename I invented for me and now i use for everything in internet.

I am a Front-End Developer and UI/Graphic Designer, I am currently studying on my own and every day I am improving my knowledge.

Responsive Web, Sass, Bootstrap, Javascript, TypeScript, npm, Gulp, ES6+, Webpack and React are some of the technologies I'm focused on and determined to conquer and absorb more and more every day.
